## Unreleased

## 0.1.0 - 2026-07-28

First release.

### Added

- `mandate reach`, a bounded breadth-first search over the authority graph that
  reports a legal call sequence breaching a declared limit, as a counterexample
  rather than a score.
- `mandate diff`, a comparison of the effective authority of two manifests,
  classified widening, narrowing, or neutral, exiting non-zero on widening.
- `mandate lint`, single-manifest control checks covering separation of duties,
  ungated irreversible effects, service-account principals, ceilings scoped to
  something the tool does not require, and mixed currencies.
- `mandate verify`, replay of recorded tool calls against the manifest,
  reporting undeclared tools, exceeded ceilings, missing approvals, wrong
  principals, and run totals.
- A manifest schema carrying the three facts an ordinary tool schema omits:
  effect class, the value-bearing argument, and the scope a ceiling is measured
  against.
- Worked examples for a payment-dispute agent, including the release pair where
  adding one read-only tool takes extractable value from 500 to 2000 GBP.
- `--json` on every analysis command, and exit codes suitable for a CI gate.
- `mandate scan`, which derives a manifest skeleton from an MCP `tools/list`
  catalogue. Effects are guessed from the tool name and default to
  `irreversible`, and every guess carries a `REVIEW` marker, because a tool
  schema cannot supply reversibility, the value argument, or the scope a
  ceiling is measured against.
- A second breach class in `reach`: an irreversible effect reachable with no
  approval is now reported with the call sequence that reaches it, rather than
  only as a name in the authority summary.
- `mandate diff --record`, a markdown change record for a change advisory
  board, with the authority section derived rather than asserted.
- A `currency_mismatch` violation in `verify`, so a call spending one currency
  against a ceiling declared in another is reported rather than silently summed.
- Status badges, an exit-code table, and the pull-request workflow snippet for
  gating on an authority diff against the default branch.
