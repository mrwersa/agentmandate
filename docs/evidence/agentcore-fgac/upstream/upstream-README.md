# End-to-end AgentCore Demo

> ⚠️ **WARNING — Proof of concept, development use only.**
>
> This project exists to demonstrate and explore the AgentCore
> authorization flow. It is **not ready for production use** and **must not
> be deployed to a production environment.**

A proof of concept that wires **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore** (Gateway,
Identity, Policy) to an HTTPS backend, with **Okta** as the IdP and
JWT-based authorization end-to-end. Private VPC backend support will
follow once the Terraform provider lands it (see [Out of scope](#out-of-scope)).

The application is a small eCommerce service for gaming consoles. It exposes
six REST APIs split into two roles, customer and admin:

| Role | Tools |
|---|---|
| customer | list products, add to cart, checkout |
| admin | add product, update price, update stock |

Role membership lives in Okta groups. The same `role` claim flows through
every layer of the stack — from Okta into the access token, through
AgentCore Gateway and Cedar policy evaluation, across an RFC 8693 token
exchange, into ALB native JWT validation, and finally into the FastAPI app.

![Architecture diagram: the agent client's request traverses AgentCore
Gateway, AgentCore Policy (Cedar), an RFC 8693 token exchange via AgentCore
Identity, ALB native jwt-validation, and the FastAPI app on ECS Fargate,
with Okta as the external IdP and RDS, ECR, Secrets Manager, KMS,
CloudWatch, Route 53 and ACM as supporting services.](docs/agentcore-architecture.png)

The diagram above traces the request path and the [four authorization
checkpoints](#architecture) end to end. It's generated from
[docs/diagram/architecture.py](docs/diagram/architecture.py) using the
official AWS Architecture Icons — re-render with
`cd docs/diagram && .venv/bin/python architecture.py`.

## What's in here

- **[app/](app/)** — Python / FastAPI eCommerce service. Emits OpenAPI 3.1
  for AgentCore Gateway target import. Trusts the bearer token validated by
  the ALB and parses `sub` / `role`.
- **[infra/](infra/)** — Terraform, split into two stacks under
  [`infra/envs/dev/`](infra/envs/dev/):
  - **[platform/](infra/envs/dev/platform/)** — VPC, RDS, ECS+Fargate, an
    ALB (internet-facing by default for testing — see
    [Out of scope](#out-of-scope)) with native [`jwt-validation`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/listener-verify-jwt.html),
    Route53, ACM. Deployable standalone.
  - **[agentcore/](infra/envs/dev/agentcore/)** — AgentCore Identity,
    Gateway, and Policy engine. Reads the platform stack via
    `terraform_remote_state`.
- **[scripts/](scripts/)** — helpers for the post-apply CLI shims (see
  [Provider gaps](#provider-gaps)) and for smoke-testing.
- **[docs/](docs/)** — deeper writeups:
  - **[docs/okta-setup.md](docs/okta-setup.md)** — Okta configuration, step
    by step.
  - **[docs/auth.md](docs/auth.md)** — the four authorization checkpoints
    and the two-JWT model in detail.

Cedar is default-deny and the policy engine ships in `ENFORCE` mode. To
dry-run new policies, set `policy_engine_mode = "LOG_ONLY"` in tfvars,
re-attach, and watch decisions land in CloudWatch before flipping back.

See **[docs/auth.md](docs/auth.md)** for what each checkpoint validates,
why two distinct JWTs exist, and the failure-mode reference.

## Deploying

### Prerequisites

- AWS account with admin or equivalent permissions, AWS CLI configured.
- A Route53 hosted zone you control (the ALB needs a publicly-trusted ACM
  cert — see [docs/auth.md → Why ALB TLS must chain to a public CA](docs/auth.md#why-the-albs-tls-cert-must-chain-to-a-public-ca)).
- Okta tenant configured per **[docs/okta-setup.md](docs/okta-setup.md)**.
- Terraform ≥ 1.6, `aws` CLI v2, `jq`, `podman` (or `docker`), `uv`.

### 1. Deploy the platform stack

```bash
cd infra/envs/dev/platform
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars   # fill in Okta + DNS values
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Defaults make the ALB **internet-facing** so you can smoke-test JWT
validation from outside the VPC. The variables `alb_internet_facing = false`
and `alb_ingress_cidrs = []` exist for a fully-private deploy, but that
path has **not** been validated end-to-end yet — AgentCore Gateway → ALB
over private connectivity is the next test on the list.

### 2. Build and push the application image

Use a unique tag per build so Terraform sees a diff and rolls out a new task
definition revision. Reusing `:latest` won't trigger a redeploy.

```bash
ECR_URL=$(terraform output -raw ecr_repository_url)
IMAGE_TAG=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)   # or: $(date -u +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)

aws ecr get-login-password | podman login --username AWS --password-stdin "${ECR_URL%/*}"
podman build --platform linux/arm64 -t "${ECR_URL}:${IMAGE_TAG}" ../../../../app/
podman push "${ECR_URL}:${IMAGE_TAG}"

# Wire the new image into tfvars and apply.
sed -i.bak '/^container_image *=/d' terraform.tfvars
echo "container_image = \"${ECR_URL}:${IMAGE_TAG}\"" >> terraform.tfvars
terraform apply
```

### 3. Bootstrap the database

RDS is in private subnets. The bootstrap runs as a one-off Fargate task
inside the VPC, reusing the app's task definition with an overridden
command:

```bash
scripts/bootstrap_remote_db.sh
```

The script tails the bootstrap task's CloudWatch logs and exits with the
task's exit code. Re-runnable — table creation and seed data are both
idempotent.

### 4. Smoke-test the ALB JWT validation

With the ALB internet-facing, you can verify end-to-end JWT validation
before involving AgentCore:

```bash
export OKTA_ISSUER=https://<tenant>.okta.com/oauth2/<authzServerId>
export OKTA_CLIENT_ID=<client-id>
# Either obtain a real user token via PKCE...
export OKTA_ACCESS_TOKEN=$(scripts/get_token.py)
# ...or paste one from Okta's Token Preview tool.

scripts/test_jwt.sh
```

The script hits the ALB with and without the token — expect 200 from the
app on the first call and 401 from the ALB on the second.

### 5. Generate the OpenAPI spec for the Gateway

The Gateway target reads the spec inline at plan time:

```bash
cd app && uv run python ../scripts/export_openapi.py ../openapi.json
```

Re-run whenever the API surface changes.

### 6. Deploy the agentcore stack

```bash
cd infra/envs/dev/agentcore
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars   # fill in Okta values
terraform init
terraform apply
```

The agentcore stack reads the platform stack's outputs automatically. It
provisions everything except the pieces called out in
[Provider gaps](#provider-gaps) below.

### 7. Apply post-`terraform apply` shims

Three pieces of the AgentCore configuration aren't yet expressible in the
Terraform AWS provider — see [Provider gaps](#provider-gaps).

**7a. Create the Cedar policies inside the policy engine** using the
engine ARN and gateway ARN that Terraform output:

```bash
ENGINE_ID=$(terraform output -raw policy_engine_id)
GATEWAY_ARN=$(terraform output -raw gateway_arn)

aws bedrock-agentcore-control create-policy \
  --policy-engine-id "$ENGINE_ID" \
  --name "ecommerce_customer_access" \
  --definition "{\"cedar\":{\"statement\":\"permit(principal is AgentCore::OAuthUser, action in [AgentCore::Action::\\\"ecommerce-tools___list_products\\\", AgentCore::Action::\\\"ecommerce-tools___add_to_cart\\\", AgentCore::Action::\\\"ecommerce-tools___checkout\\\"], resource == AgentCore::Gateway::\\\"$GATEWAY_ARN\\\") when { principal.hasTag(\\\"role\\\") && principal.getTag(\\\"role\\\") == \\\"customer\\\" };\"}}" \
  --validation-mode FAIL_ON_ANY_FINDINGS

aws bedrock-agentcore-control create-policy \
  --policy-engine-id "$ENGINE_ID" \
  --name "ecommerce_admin_access" \
  --definition "{\"cedar\":{\"statement\":\"permit(principal is AgentCore::OAuthUser, action, resource == AgentCore::Gateway::\\\"$GATEWAY_ARN\\\") when { principal.hasTag(\\\"role\\\") && principal.getTag(\\\"role\\\") == \\\"admin\\\" };\"}}" \
  --validation-mode FAIL_ON_ANY_FINDINGS
```

**7b. Attach the policy engine to the gateway** (`ENFORCE` by default,
controlled by `policy_engine_mode` in tfvars):

```bash
scripts/attach_policy_engine.sh
```

**7c. Configure `onBehalfOfTokenExchangeConfig` on the OAuth2 credential
provider** so AgentCore Identity can perform RFC 8693 token exchanges
against Okta. The update API replaces the whole `customOauth2ProviderConfig`
rather than merging, so `oauthDiscovery` and the client credentials must
be re-supplied alongside the new field. Pull them from the agentcore stack's
tfvars so they stay in sync with what Terraform created:

```bash
tfvar() {
  grep -E "^${1}[[:space:]]*=" infra/envs/dev/agentcore/terraform.tfvars \
    | head -1 | sed -E 's/^[^"]*"([^"]*)".*/\1/'
}
TEX_OKTA_ISSUER=$(tfvar okta_issuer)
TEX_OKTA_CLIENT_ID=$(tfvar okta_client_id)
TEX_OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET=$(tfvar okta_client_secret)

aws bedrock-agentcore-control update-oauth2-credential-provider \
  --name agentcore_ecommerce_dev_okta \
  --credential-provider-vendor CustomOauth2 \
  --oauth2-provider-config-input "{
    \"customOauth2ProviderConfig\": {
      \"oauthDiscovery\": {
        \"discoveryUrl\": \"${TEX_OKTA_ISSUER}/.well-known/openid-configuration\"
      },
      \"clientId\": \"${TEX_OKTA_CLIENT_ID}\",
      \"clientSecret\": \"${TEX_OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET}\",
      \"onBehalfOfTokenExchangeConfig\": {
        \"grantType\": \"TOKEN_EXCHANGE\",
        \"tokenExchangeGrantTypeConfig\": { \"actorTokenContent\": \"NONE\" }
      }
    }
  }"
```

Without `onBehalfOfTokenExchangeConfig` the gateway's outbound flow fails
with `OnBehalfOfTokenExchangeConfig is required in the OBO flow`. Omitting
`oauthDiscovery` (or the client credentials) fails the update with
`Missing required parameter in oauth2ProviderConfigInput.customOauth2ProviderConfig`.

Decisions land in `/aws/bedrock-agentcore/gateways/<id>` in CloudWatch.
For a dry-run pass — to inspect what Cedar *would* deny without blocking
calls — set `policy_engine_mode = "LOG_ONLY"` in tfvars and re-run
`scripts/attach_policy_engine.sh`.

## Testing the gateway

End-to-end: derive an inbound user JWT from the **Web Application** Okta
client (step 2a in [docs/okta-setup.md](docs/okta-setup.md)), then point
[MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) at the
gateway URL with that JWT.

### 1. Derive a user token

[scripts/get_token.py](scripts/get_token.py) runs the Authorization Code +
PKCE flow against Okta and prints the access token to stdout. Use the
**Web Application's** client id and secret here — that's the app
configured for the `Authorization Code` grant and that the gateway
authorizer's `allowed_clients` accepts.

```bash
export OKTA_ISSUER=https://<tenant>.okta.com/oauth2/<authzServerId>
export OKTA_CLIENT_ID=<web-app-client-id>
export OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET=<web-app-client-secret>

TOKEN=$(scripts/get_token.py)
```

A browser window opens for Okta sign-in; sign in as a user assigned to
either `agentcore-demo-customers` or `agentcore-demo-admins`. The script
defaults to scopes `gateway.invoke openid` and a redirect URI of
`http://localhost:8080/callback` — both must be registered on the Web
Application in Okta.

### 2. Connect MCP Inspector to the gateway

Grab the gateway URL Terraform exported from the agentcore stack and
launch the inspector:

```bash
cd infra/envs/dev/agentcore
GATEWAY_URL=$(terraform output -raw gateway_url)

npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

In the inspector UI:

- **Transport type**: `Streamable HTTP`
- **URL**: `$GATEWAY_URL` from above
- **Authentication** → **Bearer Token**: paste `$TOKEN`

Click **Connect**, then **List Tools**. You should see the six eCommerce
operations from the OpenAPI spec. Invoke one (e.g. `list_products`) — the
call traverses all four checkpoints in
[docs/auth.md](docs/auth.md): gateway authorizer → Cedar → RFC 8693
exchange → ALB jwt-validation → FastAPI.

If the policy engine is in `ENFORCE` and you signed in as a customer,
`add_product` / `update_price` / `update_stock` should return a Cedar
deny. In `LOG_ONLY` every call succeeds; check
`/aws/bedrock-agentcore/gateways/<id>` in CloudWatch to see the decision
Cedar *would* have made.

## Provider gaps

The `hashicorp/aws` provider (v6.47) doesn't yet cover three pieces of the
AgentCore surface:

| Gap | Workaround |
|---|---|
| Attaching a policy engine to a gateway (`UpdateGateway.policyEngineConfiguration`). | [scripts/attach_policy_engine.sh](scripts/attach_policy_engine.sh) |
| Cedar policy text inside a policy engine (no `aws_bedrockagentcore_policy` resource). | `aws bedrock-agentcore-control create-policy` against the engine ARN that Terraform outputs. |
| `onBehalfOfTokenExchangeConfig` on the OAuth2 credential provider. | `aws bedrock-agentcore-control update-oauth2-credential-provider` (see [docs/auth.md → Outbound](docs/auth.md#outbound-rfc-8693-token-exchange-between-2-and-3)). |

None of the gaps affect the security model — they're code-organization
gaps, not authorization gaps.

## Cleaning up

Tear the stacks down in **reverse order of deployment**: agentcore first,
then platform.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before running `terraform destroy` in the agentcore stack you **must
> detach the policy engine from the gateway**. The attachment was made
> out-of-band by [scripts/attach_policy_engine.sh](scripts/attach_policy_engine.sh)
> (see [Provider gaps](#provider-gaps)), so Terraform doesn't know about
> it. Destroying the `aws_bedrockagentcore_policy_engine` resource while
> a gateway still references it fails with a dependency error.

### 1. Detach the policy engine from the gateway

Either route is fine — use the AWS console or the CLI.

**Console:** Bedrock AgentCore → Gateways → *your gateway* → **Edit** →
under *Policy engine*, choose **None** → **Save**.

**AWS CLI:** `update-gateway` requires the gateway's existing fields to
be re-passed, so the simplest approach is to fetch the current
configuration and re-submit it without `--policy-engine-configuration`:

```bash
cd infra/envs/dev/agentcore

REGION="$(awk -F'=' '/^aws_region/ {gsub(/[" ]/, "", $2); print $2; exit}' terraform.tfvars)"
GATEWAY_ID="$(terraform output -raw gateway_id)"

GW_JSON="$(aws bedrock-agentcore-control get-gateway \
  --region "${REGION}" --gateway-identifier "${GATEWAY_ID}")"

aws bedrock-agentcore-control update-gateway \
  --region "${REGION}" \
  --gateway-identifier "${GATEWAY_ID}" \
  --name              "$(echo "${GW_JSON}" | jq -r '.name')" \
  --role-arn          "$(echo "${GW_JSON}" | jq -r '.roleArn')" \
  --authorizer-type   "$(echo "${GW_JSON}" | jq -r '.authorizerType')" \
  --authorizer-configuration "$(echo "${GW_JSON}" | jq -c '.authorizerConfiguration')" \
  --protocol-configuration   "$(echo "${GW_JSON}" | jq -c '.protocolConfiguration')"

# Verify — should print null.
aws bedrock-agentcore-control get-gateway \
  --region "${REGION}" --gateway-identifier "${GATEWAY_ID}" \
  --query 'policyEngineConfiguration' --output json
```

### 2. Delete the Cedar policies inside the policy engine

Cedar policies were also created out-of-band (step 7a), so Terraform won't
remove them — and the policy engine resource won't delete while it still
contains policies.

```bash
ENGINE_ID=$(terraform output -raw policy_engine_id)

aws bedrock-agentcore-control list-policies \
  --policy-engine-id "$ENGINE_ID" \
  --query 'policies[].policyId' --output text | tr '\t' '\n' | \
while read -r POLICY_ID; do
  [ -z "$POLICY_ID" ] && continue
  aws bedrock-agentcore-control delete-policy \
    --policy-engine-id "$ENGINE_ID" \
    --policy-identifier "$POLICY_ID"
done
```

### 3. Destroy the agentcore stack

```bash
cd infra/envs/dev/agentcore
terraform destroy
```

### 4. Empty the ECR repository, then destroy the platform stack

Terraform won't delete an ECR repo that still contains images:

```bash
cd infra/envs/dev/platform
ECR_NAME="$(terraform output -raw ecr_repository_url | awk -F'/' '{print $NF}')"
aws ecr batch-delete-image \
  --repository-name "$ECR_NAME" \
  --image-ids "$(aws ecr list-images --repository-name "$ECR_NAME" --query 'imageIds' --output json)"

terraform destroy
```

Route53 / ACM resources are managed by Terraform and will be removed by
the platform destroy. Anything you created manually in Okta (app, authz
server, groups) is out of scope here — clean up in the Okta admin console
if needed.

## Out of scope

- UI / front-end.
- Payments and order fulfilment.
- Token revocation, refresh handling, Okta lifecycle automation.
- Hiding admin tool names from `tools/list` for non-admin callers (Cedar
  enforces `tools/call` only — admin tool names are visible in discovery,
  but invocation is denied).
- Multi-region deployment, observability stack, alerting.
- **Fully-private ALB.** The Terraform variables (`alb_internet_facing`,
  `alb_ingress_cidrs`) are wired up, but the only path tested so far is the
  internet-facing ALB. AgentCore Gateway → fully-private ALB via VPC
  connectivity is on the to-do list. The mechanism (VPC Lattice resource
  gateway, managed or self-managed) is documented in the AWS blog
  [Configuring Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Gateway for secure access to
  private resources](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/configuring-amazon-bedrock-agentcore-gateway-for-secure-access-to-private-resources/).
